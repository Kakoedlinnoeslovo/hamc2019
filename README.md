# Hypotheses and Models in Data Intensive Domains Course, @hamc2019, Masters 1/2
Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, Moscow State University

Classes: Wednesday, 18.30 - 20.00

## Course overview
This is one term course, which provides a survey of the theory and application of methods to work with hypotheses and models in data intensive domains. Topics covered include overview of different approaches to hypotheses and models formulation, representation, tests, logic and probabilistic inference, model quality assessment.
This course is part of a sequence of courses on Big Data track and is taught for 1st and 2nd year masters students.


## Course outcomes
- The main objective of this course is to overview hypothesis-driven approach and the skills needed to do empirical research in data-intensive domains 
- The course aims to provide students with techniques and receipts for applying statistical/probabilistic framework to assess quality of models 
- The course will also emphasize recent developments in hypothesis management and will present some open questions and areas of ongoing research
